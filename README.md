## Note ##

This software is made to make a host, which is not accessible from the world wide web, accessible from the world wide web.

## Prerequisites & Installation ##

You need ...

#### A host ####
Any computer running a HTTP server with your web project. Can be Windows, Linux, MacOS. ARM Linux is also supported.

#### A logMeIn Hamachi account ####
(Or any other VPN service which allows HTTP connections.)

Register for Hamachi. Then create a new network and download the client on your host (the PC your are running your website). Join your network.
On Windows, you might disable the firewall for Hamachi.

#### A vServer ####
(If you already have another server with root permissions, which is accessible from the WWW, you can take this one).

You need a vServer running Linux (as it is the cheapest, it would also work with Windows). I recommend Ubuntu or Debian, but it will work with any other distribution too. 
You can go to ionos.de, there you can buy one for 1â‚¬ / month. You can also go to Google Cloud Console and use your free credits for 6 months, but then you need to switch.
If you use another site, make sure the server is accessible from the world wide web.

Then, install the following things:
- PHP 8 with curl + Apache2. You can use this tutorial: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/install-php-8-for-apache-and-nginx-on-ubuntu/. Make sure to chose Apache and not nginx!
- LogMeIn Hamachi. Install it, then join your network. Then reboot.
- Make a wget request to your host using the IP provided by Hamachi to check if the connection is established.

After that...
- Grab the index.php file and the .htaccess file from this repository with your vServer
- Move them to your Apache root directory
- Edit the index.php file and add the Hamachi IP address of the host

THAT'S IT!

## BUG FIXES ##
It may not work because your local web server detects that the request is going to another hostname.
You may fix it like this:
- Run a clean install of Apache on your local device (no "dashboards")
- Add the domain of your remote host to your local devices web server (may also work with dashboards, f.e. TinyCP)
